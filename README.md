# Ukrainian European Social Survey 2022

## Description
This repository contains the dataset, questionnaires (in Ukrainian and Russian), and a description of the weighting procedure of the associated study conducted in Ukraine using the ESS 10 questionnaire. It also includes a log file that documents all versions of the dataset and records the changes made in each version.

The survey was organised and conducted by the Ukrainian national team, led by national coordinators Tymofii Brik (Kyiv School of Economics) and Andrii Gorbachyk (Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv).

The fieldwork took place between 18 January and 8 February 2022 and was conducted through personal interviews (CAPI). Data collection was carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). The study employed a three-stage random sampling design representative of the population of Ukraine aged 15 years and older living in territories controlled by the Ukrainian government before 24 February 2022. Stratification was applied by region (24 Ukrainian oblasts and Kyiv city) and by the settlement type (urban or rural), resulting in 49 strata. At the first stage, electoral precincts within each stratum were selected randomly (300 precincts in total). At the second stage, households were chosen using a random walk procedure within the selected electoral precincts. In the final stage, within each participating household, the interviewer randomly selected one eligible respondent from the list of household members. In total, 1531 respondents were successfully interviewed. 

The study was supported by a grant from the International Renaissance Foundation and the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden in Ukraine as part of the project "Ukraine in the European Social Survey 2021" (agreement signed on 15 November 2021).
